A React application demonstrating the integration of 3D graphics using Three.js and React Three Fiber.

# React 3D Visualization

This project showcases the integration of 3D graphics within a React application using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber). It serves as a foundational example for building interactive 3D experiences in web applications.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to render 3D objects within a React application. By leveraging Three.js for 3D rendering and React Three Fiber as a React renderer for Three.js, developers can create complex 3D scenes with declarative components.

## Features

- **3D Rendering:** Display interactive 3D objects within a React component.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures 3D content adjusts to various screen sizes.
- **Modular Components:** Clean separation of 3D objects into reusable React components.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.
